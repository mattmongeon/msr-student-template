## Overview
I graduated from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](illinois.edu) in 2005 with a BS in computer engineering and then worked for nine years as a software engineer at [Frasca International](http://www.frasca.com), a flight simulation company, the latter half of which I served as lead software engineer.  In 2015 I earned a [Master's of Science in Robotics](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/) at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu) and began a position as Electrical Engineer in the [Center for Bionic Medicine](http://www.ric.org/research/research-centers--programs/bionic-medicine/) at the [Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago](http://www.ric.org).
