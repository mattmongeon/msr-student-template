## Overview
I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005 with a BS in computer engineering.  I spent nine years as a software engineer in the flight simulation industry, the last five of which as lead software engineer.  I am now enrolled in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University with expected completion in August 2015.
