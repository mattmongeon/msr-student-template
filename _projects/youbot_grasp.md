## Overview
This project is a ROS package called youbot_grasp_msr which controls the arm of the [KUKA youBot](http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/service_robotics/research_education/youbot/) to grasp an object at various positions around it.  Currently it only grasps an object (always a small wooden block during testing) at a specific position near the youBot.  The project is on GitHub at [this location](https://github.com/mattmongeon/youbot_grasp_msr).  See [this video](https://vimeo.com/114483339) to see it in action.
